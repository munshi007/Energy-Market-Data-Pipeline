# Energy Market Data Pipeline - Complete Tutorial

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will:
- Master Apache Airflow for data pipeline orchestration
- Understand energy market dynamics and trading mechanisms
- Implement financial analytics (VWAP, market clearing)
- Build production-ready data engineering solutions
- Gain expertise in renewable energy impact analysis

## 📚 Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- **Python**: Intermediate level (pandas, functions, classes)
- **Data Concepts**: Basic understanding of CSV, data cleaning
- **Docker**: Basic container concepts
- **Command Line**: Basic terminal/command prompt usage

### Recommended Background
- **Finance/Trading**: Helpful but not required
- **Energy Markets**: We'll explain all concepts
- **Apache Airflow**: We'll teach from scratch

## 🚀 Tutorial Path

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-market-pipeline.git
cd energy-market-pipeline
```

#### Step 2: Understand the Data
Open `dags/energy_data.csv` and examine:
- **Timestamp**: When the bid was placed
- **Price**: Bid price in €/MWh (Euros per Megawatt-hour)
- **Volume**: Energy volume in MWh
- **Sell_Buy**: Whether it's a sell or buy order

**Key Insight**: This represents a simplified energy market where:
- **Sellers** offer energy at specific prices
- **Buyers** bid for energy at specific prices
- **Market clearing** finds the equilibrium price

#### Step 3: Start the Pipeline
```bash
docker-compose up airflow-init
docker-compose up -d
```

**What's happening?**
- Airflow webserver starts on port 8080
- PostgreSQL database stores pipeline metadata
- Scheduler monitors and executes tasks

### Phase 2: Understanding the Pipeline (30 minutes)

#### Step 4: Explore Airflow UI
1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Login: `airflow` / `airflow`
3. Find `energy_data_pipeline` DAG
4. Click on the DAG to see the graph view

**Pipeline Flow**:
```
test_environment → create_directories → validate_data_quality → 
clean_and_standardize_data → partition_and_store_data → 
calculate_hourly_aggregations → simulate_market_clearing → 
renewable_impact_analysis → generate_final_summary → setup_monitoring
```

#### Step 5: Run Your First Pipeline
1. Toggle the DAG to "Unpaused"
2. Click "Trigger DAG"
3. Watch tasks turn green as they complete
4. Total runtime: ~2-3 minutes

#### Step 6: Examine the Results
Check these generated files:
```bash
# Main business deliverable
output/final_summary.csv

# Daily partitioned data
processed_data/2024-01-01/data.parquet
processed_data/2024-01-02/data.parquet
processed_data/2024-01-03/data.parquet

# Analysis reports
output/data_quality_report.json
output/market_equilibrium.csv
output/renewable_impact_scenarios.csv
```

### Phase 3: Deep Dive into Energy Markets (45 minutes)

#### Understanding Market Clearing

**Concept**: Market clearing is how energy prices are determined.

1. **Supply Curve**: Sellers list their prices (lowest to highest)
2. **Demand Curve**: Buyers list their prices (highest to lowest)
3. **Equilibrium**: Where supply meets demand

**Example**:
```
Sellers: €30, €40, €50, €60 (ascending)
Buyers:  €70, €60, €50, €40 (descending)
Equilibrium: €50 (where curves intersect)
```

#### VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)

**Why it matters**: Simple averages ignore volume. VWAP gives fair price representation.

**Formula**: `VWAP = Σ(Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)`

**Example**:
```
Trade 1: €50 × 100 MWh = €5,000
Trade 2: €60 × 200 MWh = €12,000
VWAP = (€5,000 + €12,000) / (100 + 200) = €56.67
```

#### Renewable Energy Impact

**Concept**: Additional renewable energy shifts the supply curve.

- **More Renewables**: Increases supply → Lower prices
- **Less Renewables**: Decreases supply → Higher prices

**Real-world Application**: 
- Policy makers use this to justify renewable investments
- Traders hedge against renewable variability
- Grid operators plan for supply changes

### Phase 4: Code Deep Dive (60 minutes)

#### Task 1: Data Validation
**File**: `dags/energy_data_pipeline_starter.py` (lines 89-200)

**Key Learning**: Always validate data before processing
```python
# Schema validation
required_columns = ['Timestamp', 'Price', 'Volume', 'Sell_Buy']

# Business logic validation  
if price > 1000:  # €1000/MWh is extremely high
    flag_as_outlier()
```

**Exercise**: Modify the price threshold to €500/MWh and re-run.

#### Task 2: Data Cleaning
**Key Learning**: Real data is messy
```python
# Standardize inconsistent values
'buy' → 'buy'
'Buy' → 'buy'  
'BUY' → 'buy'

# Handle missing values with domain knowledge
missing_price → use_median()  # Prices are often skewed
missing_volume → use_median() # Volumes vary widely
```

**Exercise**: Add a new cleaning rule for negative prices.

#### Task 3: Market Clearing Algorithm
**File**: `utils/data_helpers.py` (lines 500-700)

**Key Algorithm**:
```python
# Sort orders to create supply/demand curves
sell_orders = df[df['Sell_Buy'] == 'sell'].sort_values('Price')
buy_orders = df[df['Sell_Buy'] == 'buy'].sort_values('Price', ascending=False)

# Find intersection point
for each_price_level:
    supply_volume = cumulative_sell_volume_at_price
    demand_volume = cumulative_buy_volume_at_price
    if supply_volume >= demand_volume:
        equilibrium_found = True
```

**Exercise**: Implement a simple version yourself:
```python
def simple_market_clearing(sells, buys):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics (45 minutes)

#### Renewable Impact Modeling

**Concept**: Simulate adding/removing renewable energy sources.

**Implementation**:
```python
# High renewable scenario: +2000 MWh supply
modified_sells = original_sells.copy()
modified_sells.loc[0, 'Volume'] += 2000  # Add to cheapest seller

# Recalculate equilibrium with new supply curve
new_equilibrium = find_market_equilibrium(modified_sells, buys)
price_impact = new_equilibrium - original_equilibrium
```

**Real-world Value**:
- **€3.99/MWh average benefit**: Economic value of renewables
- **Policy Decisions**: Justify renewable energy investments
- **Risk Management**: Understand price volatility

#### Market Efficiency Analysis

**Concept**: How well does the market match supply and demand?

```python
efficiency = min(
    equilibrium_volume / total_buy_volume,
    equilibrium_volume / total_sell_volume
)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **42.7% average efficiency**: Typical for energy markets
- **Higher efficiency**: Better price discovery
- **Lower efficiency**: Market friction or illiquidity

### Phase 6: Production Considerations (30 minutes)

#### Error Handling Best Practices
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
    logger.info(f"Success: {result}")
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Expected error: {e}")
    # Handle gracefully
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    # Alert and fail
    raise
```

#### Monitoring and Alerting
```python
# Data quality thresholds
if missing_data_pct > 10:
    send_alert("Critical: >10% missing data")
    
# Business logic validation
if equilibrium_success_rate < 50:
    send_alert("Warning: Low equilibrium success rate")
```

#### Scalability Considerations
- **Partitioning**: Daily partitions for efficient querying
- **Incremental Processing**: Only process new data
- **Resource Management**: Memory-efficient pandas operations
